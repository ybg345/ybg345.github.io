#### About the Site 

It's a static website which is made using ***HTML***, ***CSS***, ***JavaScript*** & ***Bootstrap*** only. 

> The original project is a template downloaded from internet. Unfortunately I am unable to share the origin reference as I couldn't remember from where I downloaded it. Thanks to the  developer who created the original version. 
> 
> After downloading the original project I heavily customized it as per my own requirement. 
> 
> You are welcome to fork/download the project, customize it and use as your own.
